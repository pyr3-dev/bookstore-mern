# bookstore-mern

Fullstack MERN Bookstore Project from FreeCodeCamp.org

A beginner's MERN stack project

it has both backend and front end

The backend uses `Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose and MongoDB`

The frontend uses `vite, react, react-router-dom, tailwindcss, notistack and axios`

## Detailed explanation of components

Backend

`MongoDB` - is used for Database

`Node.js` - is a javascript runtime

`Mongoose` - a Javascript driver for MongoDB

`Express.js` - a routing framework used for making API.

Frontend

`Vite` - a development environment for react

`React` - a frontend Javascript library

`react-router-dom` - enables dynamic routing in the web app

`Tailwind CSS` - a CSS framework

`axios` - used to send http requests to the backend. essential in communicating with the Express framework

`notistack` - a replacement for the vanilla alert bubble.

## How to use

**You need to run both front-end and back-end**

go to `backend` and `frontend` folder and run `npm run dev`

## Dependencies

`node_modules` have not been included in the repo to save bandwidth

to install the dependencies goto `backend` && `frontend` and run: `npm install` this will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

## Note

**The MongoDB Database will be deleted eventually so you need to make your own Database!!**
